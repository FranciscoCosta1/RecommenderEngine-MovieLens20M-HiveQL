# Recommender Engine using the MovieLens 20M dataset - HiveQL

Academic Project for the course of **Big Data Foundations**

Group: Francisco Costa, João Gouveia, Pedro Riveira, Nuno Rocha

Programming Language: **HiveQL, Python** (used to scrape data)

Using the 20M records ’ dataset from MovieLens, the goal of such project is to investigate the capabilities of Hadoop components to analyze large datasets.

To achieve that, the Virtual Machine of Cloudera was used, and through **HiveQL** , several tables were computed and lately updated to **PowerBI**.

As a result of those tables, it was possible not only to gather several insights regarding the movies and their ratings but also to build **two recommendation engines** (one taking into account a certain user’s preferences and other through a specific tag.
